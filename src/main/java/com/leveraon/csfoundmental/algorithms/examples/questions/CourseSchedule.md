### Solution: Course Schedule II (Topological Sort)

**Problem:** There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`. Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are multiple valid orderings, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Approach:**
This problem is a classic application of **Topological Sort** on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). There are two common algorithms for topological sort: Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based) and DFS-based. For this problem, Kahn's algorithm is often preferred for its intuitive handling of cycle detection and direct construction of the order.

**Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based):**

1.  **Graph Representation:**
    *   **Adjacency List:** Create an adjacency list (`Map<Integer, List<Integer>>` or `List<List<Integer>>`) to represent the graph, where `adj.get(u)` contains all courses `v` for which `u` is a prerequisite (`u -> v`).
    *   **In-Degrees:** Create an array `inDegree[]` where `inDegree[i]` stores the number of prerequisites for course `i`.
2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Populate the adjacency list and in-degree array based on the `prerequisites`.
    *   Add all courses with an in-degree of `0` to a `Queue`. These are the courses that can be taken first.
3.  **Processing (BFS):**
    *   While the `queue` is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a course `u`. Add `u` to the result list (topological order).
        *   For each neighbor `v` of `u` (i.e., courses that have `u` as a prerequisite):
            *   Decrement `inDegree[v]`.
            *   If `inDegree[v]` becomes `0`, enqueue `v`.
4.  **Cycle Detection:**
    *   If, after the BFS, the number of courses in the result list is less than `numCourses`, it means there's a cycle in the graph, and it's impossible to finish all courses. In this case, return an empty array. Otherwise, return the result list.

**Time Complexity:** O(V + E), where V is `numCourses` and E is the number of `prerequisites`.
    *   Building graph and in-degrees: O(V + E)
    *   BFS traversal: Each vertex and edge is processed at most once.
**Space Complexity:** O(V + E) for the adjacency list, in-degree array, and queue.

**Senior-Level Considerations:**

*   **Graph Representation:** Discuss the choice of adjacency list over adjacency matrix (sparse graphs, memory efficiency).
*   **Kahn's vs. DFS-based Topological Sort:** Explain the pros and cons of each. Kahn's (BFS) is often easier for cycle detection (count of processed nodes vs. total nodes). DFS-based involves tracking visited states (unvisited, visiting, visited) to detect back edges (cycles). For this problem, Kahn's is slightly more straightforward.
*   **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Emphasize that topological sort is only possible on a DAG. The problem implicitly tests for DAGs by requiring an empty array if a cycle exists.
*   **Real-world Applications:** Mention examples like task scheduling, dependency resolution in build systems (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and compiler optimization.
*   **Multiple Valid Orders:** Point out that if a graph has multiple valid topological sorts, any one is acceptable. The specific order generated by Kahn's depends on the order items are dequeued from the queue (which depends on how they were added when their in-degree hit zero).
