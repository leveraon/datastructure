### 1. **K Closest Points to Origin**

*   **Problem:** Given an array of `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`. The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance.
*   **DSA Focus:** Arrays, Sorting, Heaps (Priority Queues), QuickSelect/Nth_element.
*   **Senior-Level Discussion Points:**
    *   Brute-force (calculate all distances, sort, take top K) - O(N log N) time, O(N) space.
    *   Using a Max-Heap (min-heap in Python) of size `k` to store the closest points seen so far. If a new point is closer than the farest in the heap, remove the farest and add the new one. O(N log K) time, O(K) space.
    *   **Optimal:** QuickSelect (or `nth_element` in C++) approach to find the Kth smallest distance in average O(N) time. This is a good way to differentiate candidates who think about worst-case vs. average-case performance and understand partitioning algorithms.
    *   Handling duplicate distances.
    *   Floating point precision issues.

### Solution: K Closest Points to Origin 

**Problem:** Given an array of `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`. The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance.

**Approach:**
For a Senior Software Engineer interview, the most efficient and common approach expected here is using a **Max-Heap (Priority Queue)**.

1.  **Calculate Distance:** The Euclidean distance from `(0,0)` to `(x,y)` is `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. Since `sqrt` is a monotonic function, comparing `x^2 + y^2` is equivalent to comparing the actual distances and avoids floating-point issues or expensive square root operations. We'll use `x*x + y*y`.
2.  **Max-Heap of Size K:** We maintain a max-heap that stores up to `k` points. The heap will always have the `k` *closest* points encountered so far, with the *farthest* among them at the top (root) of the max-heap.
3.  **Iterate and Maintain:**
    *   For each point:
        *   Add it to the heap.
        *   If the heap size exceeds `k`, remove the top element (which is the farthest point, due to it being a max-heap).
4.  **Result:** After iterating through all points, the heap will contain the `k` closest points. Convert the heap contents to an array.

**Time Complexity:** O(N log K), where N is the number of points. Each point is added to the heap (log K) and potentially removed (log K).
**Space Complexity:** O(K) to store the points in the heap.

**Java Code:**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Comparator;

class Solution {

    /**
     * Finds the K closest points to the origin (0,0) using a Max-Heap.
     *
     * @param points An array of points, where each point is [x, y].
     * @param k The number of closest points to return.
     * @return A 2D array containing the k closest points.
     */
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        // Handle edge cases:
        if (points == null || points.length == 0 || k <= 0) {
            return new int[0][0];
        }
        if (k >= points.length) {
            return points; // All points are k closest if k is greater than or equal to total points
        }

        // Use a Max-Heap (PriorityQueue in Java is a Min-Heap by default,
        // so we use a custom comparator for a Max-Heap).
        // The comparator should order elements such that the "largest" (farthest)
        // point in terms of distance is at the top (root) of the heap.
        PriorityQueue<int[]> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (p1, p2) -> {
                // Calculate squared Euclidean distance to avoid Math.sqrt()
                // and potential floating point issues.
                // distance^2 = x^2 + y^2
                long dist1 = (long) p1[0] * p1[0] + (long) p1[1] * p1[1];
                long dist2 = (long) p2[0] * p2[0] + (long) p2[1] * p2[1];
                return Long.compare(dist2, dist1); // For max-heap, compare b,a (or a-b for min-heap)
            }
        );

        // Iterate through all points
        for (int[] point : points) {
            maxHeap.offer(point); // Add the current point to the heap

            // If the heap size exceeds k, remove the farthest point (root of max-heap)
            if (maxHeap.size() > k) {
                maxHeap.poll();
            }
        }

        // The heap now contains the k closest points.
        // Convert the heap contents to a 2D array.
        int[][] result = new int[k][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            result[i] = maxHeap.poll();
        }

        return result;
    }

    // --- Example Usage ---
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Test Case 1
        int[][] points1 = {{1, 3}, {-2, 2}};
        int k1 = 1;
        int[][] result1 = sol.kClosest(points1, k1);
        System.out.println("Points: " + Arrays.deepToString(points1) + ", k: " + k1);
        System.out.println("Result: " + Arrays.deepToString(result1)); // Expected: [[-2, 2]] (distance sqrt(8) vs sqrt(10))

        // Test Case 2
        int[][] points2 = {{3, 3}, {5, -1}, {-2, 4}};
        int k2 = 2;
        int[][] result2 = sol.kClosest(points2, k2);
        System.out.println("\nPoints: " + Arrays.deepToString(points2) + ", k: " + k2);
        System.out.println("Result: " + Arrays.deepToString(result2)); // Expected: [[3, 3], [-2, 4]] (distances sqrt(18), sqrt(26), sqrt(20))

        // Test Case 3: k equals points.length
        int[][] points3 = {{1, 1}, {2, 2}};
        int k3 = 2;
        int[][] result3 = sol.kClosest(points3, k3);
        System.out.println("\nPoints: " + Arrays.deepToString(points3) + ", k: " + k3);
        System.out.println("Result: " + Arrays.deepToString(result3)); // Expected: [[1,1], [2,2]] (order might vary based on heap implementation, but content is same)

        // Test Case 4: Empty points array
        int[][] points4 = {};
        int k4 = 1;
        int[][] result4 = sol.kClosest(points4, k4);
        System.out.println("\nPoints: " + Arrays.deepToString(points4) + ", k: " + k4);
        System.out.println("Result: " + Arrays.deepToString(result4)); // Expected: [[]]
    }
}
```

**Senior-Level Considerations:**

*   **QuickSelect (Nth Element):** Mention that for the absolute best *average* time complexity of O(N), one could use QuickSelect (similar to QuickSort's partitioning) to find the Kth smallest distance element. Once the Kth element is in its correct sorted position, all elements to its left are the K closest. This is harder to implement robustly in a whiteboard setting due to recursion, pivoting, and handling duplicates, but it's a valuable point to discuss for optimal performance. The worst-case for QuickSelect is O(N^2), but average is O(N).
*   **Squared Distance:** Clearly articulate why you use `x*x + y*y` instead of `Math.sqrt()`. It avoids floating-point precision issues and is computationally cheaper.
*   **Comparator Logic:** Explain how the `Comparator` for `PriorityQueue` determines if it's a min-heap or max-heap (`Long.compare(dist2, dist1)` for max-heap vs. `Long.compare(dist1, dist2)` for min-heap).
*   **Edge Cases:** Discuss handling `k <= 0`, `points` being null or empty, and `k >= points.length`.
